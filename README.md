**For Project 1**, I used the `mtcars` dataset to create a simple scatter plot of *horsepower (hp)* and *miles per gallon (mpg)* with a linear regression line. Then, I applied best visualization practices, such as adding X and Y axis labels, changing the font style, and centering the title. In the final step, I intentionally made a mistake by changing the background to black. However, due to the homework rubric, I reverted the plot to its initial version.
